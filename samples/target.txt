My generation designed during a cycle when #
Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark released Dazzle Ships #
Seemingly destined to bring amazement and invention *
we bloomed after desolate and dreamy arcades -
persistent about crystallizing our passion @

Wrist watches of inspired technicians -
swift in ironing calculations of the spectrum @-
ready to embrace Japanese bondage over mushroom outings -
ready to amaze the apparition of advancement @-#
and to call out complexity that adorned our robot toys -#

Plastic symbolism signaling over circuitry @#
Foretelling repentance for choosing our adventures +-
For not waging a genuine war with sheer momentum +*-
in sonic seduction and general decline of decades @

Blissfully oblivious declining decisions made unbearable clamor @+

Rudeness and swearing solutions of wrath -@
indeterminate in their post-war abandoned rainbows -+
Ever since our skeletal acid spitting aliens @#
forced old chess masters to denounce Pac-Man champions -+
familial certainty turned its face to consumers @+-

And love and family remained true to television channeling @-----

Spiteful nursery overarching villains in sunrise @-+ <Weakest of four
romanticism seeping from warm weld-lines --#
to allot an avant-garde designer leaflet @- <lost sound
describing one basic differential guess -
we meant to make books steam with random fear -
of rare cabbage beasts prized in a fortnight -

Timid echoes in red juxtaposed in blue -+
our art binds abstraction and bids burnt offerings #
drinks ferocious blood in the creaking floorboards +
making smiling neighbors seem like timid vampires @
or greedy werewolves grocery-bent old geezers +-

We do drink milk from a dirty saucer #
while reins of slumber steal over the neon -+
but being no New York hep-cats we beg for magic +@
for one more byte of reason in the curtains of war -
in the babbling of slump and in the reign of ire -

Games video games and thunder domes promote self-awareness plans  @+

Feud of imagism brought low-resolution outlooks #
Knobs of wordplay our renowned trinkets bend -+
turning to radio when no waves disturb the air -@
We wait for enlivening for rekindling from afar -@
from the houses on the left full of turmoil @+
concealment in slimy comic moss revivals +@---

No amount of voodoo will suffice to prevent impending doom #

Through shortage we made defiance and wrath -
With advanced dragons our scholars still work #
sending them to decorate pride of a spoiled one -+
of the chosen liar from a basic hell @-
Our lore with chaff and shards born into Mars #-
a recipe for the hate game which deconstructs @-
stagnant along the waning years of synth +@
